# meteoAR :partly_sunny:

**Weather Station based in Arduino**

![meteoAR from the roof] (https://github.com/caparrosmatias/meteo/blob/master/images/foto_exterior.jpg)

This weather station was built from scratch, to use it in an astronomic observatory.

Later a .csv datafile was built with the meteo info to use it with machine learning.

It compiles information from different sensors (LM35, DHT11, BMP180, rain sensor) and save it in a SQL Database via PHP, using the arduino ethernet module.

You can find the sources each in /arduino and /web
